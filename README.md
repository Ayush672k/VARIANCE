# VARIANCE 

**VARIANCE** is an AI-powered Adobe add-on that enhances documents and templates by adapting them to regional and cultural context.

-

## Inspiration
During our internship, we worked closely with sales and marketing teams and noticed that most design templates lacked cultural and regional relevance—especially for Indian audiences. VARIANCE was created to bridge this gap using AI within Adobe’s ecosystem.

## What It Does
- Analyzes text, colors, and design elements
- Validates designs against Indian cultural datasets
- Provides instant feedback using canvas metadata
- Works via one-click automation inside Adobe

---

## How We Built It
- Extracted canvas metadata from Adobe
- Fed data into an AI analysis pipeline
- Validated design elements against cultural datasets
- Delivered insights directly inside the design workflow

---

## Challenges
- Managing AI context efficiently
- Integrating real-time analysis into one-click actions
- Ensuring performance inside an Adobe add-on
